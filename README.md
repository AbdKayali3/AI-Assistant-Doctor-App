# About

"AI Assistant Doctor" flutter application for the AI/web module we developed earlier. It will unlock the ability for a user to take a picture of their teeth or (choose an image from the device) and then send that to the AI module. In which it will validate and check if the teeth are broken or not.

This repo/app is just an MVP for the project. The project vision aims to aid in the diagnostics of CT, MRI, and X-Ray images, with the main goal of reducing misdiagnosis.
